# Hugo Web Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centric Design

All features and functionality must be designed with the end-user in mind. The user experience should be intuitive, accessible, and efficient.

### II. Security is Non-Negotiable

The application must be secure. All development must follow best practices for web application security, including the OWASP Top 10.

### III. Test-Driven Development

All new features and functionality must be developed using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. Tests must be written before the implementation, and the implementation is complete only when the tests pass.

### IV. Hugo First

This project is built using the Hugo static site generator. All content and structural changes should leverage Hugo's features and conventions first, before resorting to custom solutions.

## Governance

This constitution is the guiding document for the project. All team members are expected to adhere to its principles. Amendments to this constitution require a pull request and approval from the project lead.
