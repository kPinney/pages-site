# Implementation Plan: Personal Webpage

**Branch**: `001-static-web-app` | **Date**: 2025-09-24 | **Spec**: [Feature Specification](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-static-web-app/spec.md`

---

## Summary

This plan outlines the development of a personal webpage, which will be a static site hosted on GitHub Pages. The site will feature a bio, contact information, and a blog. The blog will be managed through markdown files, support tags, code syntax highlighting, and Mermaid diagrams. The design will be modern and responsive, with a light/dark theme toggle.

---

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Hugo  
**Storage**: N/A (content is file-based in the git repository)  
**Testing**: HTML/CSS validation, link checking, and accessibility testing.  
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers  
**Project Type**: Web application  
**Performance Goals**: Lighthouse score of 90+ for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO.  
**Constraints**: Must be deployable to GitHub Pages.  
**Scale/Scope**: A small personal website with a blog.

---

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. User-Centric Design**: The project is inherently user-centric, focusing on providing a good experience for visitors and the author.
- **II. Security is Non-Negotiable**: As a static site, the attack surface is minimal. Security considerations will focus on dependency management and secure configuration of GitHub Pages.
- **III. Code Quality and Maintainability**: Adherence to coding standards and use of a static site generator will ensure maintainability.

**Structure Decision**: A simplified web application structure suitable for a static site generator.

---

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
    - Research and decide on the most suitable static site generator (Jekyll, Hugo, Next.js, etc.) for this project, considering the requirements for GitHub Pages, Mermaid diagrams, and code highlighting.
    - Define a testing strategy for the static site. This might involve HTML/CSS validation, link checking, and accessibility testing.

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
    - Task: "Research static site generators for GitHub Pages with Mermaid and syntax highlighting support."
    - Task: "Research testing strategies for static websites."

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`.

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

---

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
    - Define the frontmatter for blog posts (title, date, tags, etc.).
    - Define the structure for bio and contact information data.

2. **Generate API contracts**: N/A for a static site.

3. **Generate contract tests**: N/A for a static site.

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
    - Create a `quickstart.md` document that outlines the steps to set up the project locally and verify that the main features are working.

5. **Update agent file incrementally**: N/A

**Output**: data-model.md, quickstart.md

---

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Set up the chosen static site generator.
- Create the basic page layouts and templates.
- Implement the bio and contact pages.
- Implement the blog functionality, including post listing, individual post pages, and tag pages.
- Implement the theme toggle.
- Style the website using the chosen CSS framework.
- Set up the GitHub Actions workflow for deployment to GitHub Pages.

**Ordering Strategy**:

- Foundational setup first (static site generator, basic layout).
- Content pages (bio, contact).
- Blog functionality.
- Styling and theme toggle.
- Deployment automation.

**Estimated Output**: 10-15 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md
