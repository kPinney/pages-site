# Research: Static Site Generator and Testing Strategy

## Static Site Generator

### Decision

After researching various static site generators, **Hugo** has been selected for this project.

### Rationale

- **GitHub Pages Compatibility**: Hugo is well-supported on GitHub Pages and has a straightforward deployment process.
- **Performance**: Hugo is known for its exceptional build speed, which is beneficial for a growing blog.
- **Mermaid and Syntax Highlighting**: Hugo has built-in support for both Mermaid diagrams and code syntax highlighting, which are key requirements.
- **Content Management**: The content-first approach of Hugo, with its powerful frontmatter and templating, aligns well with the project's needs.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Jekyll**: While it's the default for GitHub Pages, it can be slower and less flexible than Hugo.
- **Next.js/Gatsby**: These are powerful React-based frameworks, but they introduce a higher level of complexity than is necessary for this project.

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Decision

The testing strategy will focus on automated checks for quality and consistency.

### Testing Rationale

- **HTML/CSS Validation**: Use tools like `html-validator-cli` and `stylelint` to ensure the generated code is valid and follows best practices.
- **Link Checking**: Implement a script to check for broken links within the site.
- **Accessibility Testing**: Use a tool like `axe-core` to run automated accessibility checks.
- **Manual Testing**: Perform manual testing for user experience and visual consistency across major browsers.
